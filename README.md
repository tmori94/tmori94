- 👋 Hi, I’m @tmori94
- 👀 I’m interested in technologies, I enjoy the idea that with some logic and technical knowledge we can create basically everything with the help of our computer.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my skills with C# and .NET framework. From time to time I develop macros with VBA within my current working area, to improve efficiency and ease everyone's job.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that involves .NET framework, this to make me progress on my studies and enlarge my portfolio of projects.
